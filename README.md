# Node JS + Express + MongoDB REST API
REST API built with express and documented with swaggerUI/openAPI

# Setting up a dev environment

I added a Swagger UI documentation to OpenAPI specification which provides a UI for quickly testing out the API. I have also written some tests using Mocha and Chai for further review.

### Prerequisites

- git, any version
- NPM >=12.x

### Steps

1. `git clone https://github.com/mxnuchim/Express-User-REST-API.git`
2. `npm install` or `npm i`
3. `npm start` or `npm run dev`
4. Wait a bit
5. Open http://localhost:5000/api-docs to view the API documentation and test it
